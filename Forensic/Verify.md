      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p align="justify">People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.</p>

## ðŸ‘€ Hint ðŸ‘€
> Hint 1: Checksums let you tell if a file is complete and from the original distributor. If the hash doesn't match, it's a different file. <br>
> Hint 2: You can create a SHA checksum of a file with sha256sum \<file> or all files in a directory with sha256sum \<directory>/*.
> Hint 3: Remember you can pipe the output of one command to another with |. Try practicing with the 'First Grep' challenge if you're stuck!
